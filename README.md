# APGP - The Asynchronous Parallel Genetic Programming
With a fixed length initialisation Option.

Asynchronous Parallel Genetic Programming


This chapter applies the evaluation time schemes to some well-known GP applications. The problem domains are Boolean logic, robot control and classification. While later sections give details of these problems, this section provides a brief overview.

## Boolean logic - Multiplexer
For the Boolean logic applications, the multiplexer and even-parity problems are used. The challenge in the multiplexer problem (henceforth termed Multiplexer) \cite{oai:IEEE-CS:10.1109/EH.1999.785434, koza1992genetic} is for GP to use Boolean logic operators to reproduce the behaviour of an electronic multiplexer given all its possible input and output values. 

## Boolean logic - Even Parity
The challenge in the even-parity problem (Parity) \cite{harding2009self, koza1992genetic} is for GP to use Boolean logic operators to find a solution that produces the value of the Boolean even parity given $n$ independent Boolean inputs.  

## Robot Rontrol: ANT
For the robot control application, GP is used to evolve solutions to the well known artificial ant problem (ANT) \cite{iba:1996:aigp2, koza1992genetic}. The challenge in ANT is to evolve a routine for navigating a robotic ant on a virtual field to help it find food items within a given time limit. 

## Classification with GPML
The classification application uses a hybridisation of GP with machine learning (GPML). Like MLR-GP in Chapter~\ref{Chapter8}, the hybridisation involves GP and machine learning (GPML), whereas here it is for classification; GP engineers a set of features and then logistic regression \cite{kleinbaum2002logistic} uses these features to build a classification model.
